##Installation
1. Drop the plugin in your server folder.
2. Create a new incoming webhook and set it up however you would like.
3. Start and stop the server.
4. Copy the webhook URL and set webhook: in the config.yml to that.
5. Start the server.


Verified compatible with CraftBukkit, Spigot, Spigot/CraftBukkit 1.8, and Glowstone. Definitely works with any Bukkit API server, probably.

###Slack setup
1. Log into your Slack account and go to https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook
2. Click on the Add New Integration link on the left-hand side.
3. Scroll down and select Incoming Webhooks.
4. Select a channel/direct message recipient and click the green Add Incoming WebHook button.
5. A green "New Integration added!" confirmation message will appear. Scroll down the page and copy the URL under "Your Unique Webhook URL." It will look something like this: https://yourcompany.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
6. Under the Integration Settings section, you have the option to label your integration, change the name of your Slack bot and its icon. By default, the bot name is incoming-webhook and the default icon is a Sprintly icon. These are optional settings.
7. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the blue Save Integration button.

**slack.hide.logout** - _does not post to Slack when you login._

##Custom Messages
On the server, you may use
**/slack send <username> <image URL> <message>**
to send a custom message to Slack.
You can use **null** as image URL to use the username's minecraft head skin.

Programmatically, you can add the plugin as a dependency, and then import the API for the platform you're using (either Bukkit or BungeeCord)
```java
import us.circuitsoft.slack.api.BukkitPoster
```
or
```java
import us.circuitsoft.slack.api.BungeePoster
```

If you're using Bukkit,
```java
new BukkitPoster(message, name, iconUrl).runTaskAsynchronously(this);
```
where message is the message you want to send to Slack, name is the username, and iconUrl is the image URL. You can set iconUrl to null if name is a Minecraft player username, it will then use the player's skin head.

If you're using BungeeCord, 
```java
getProxy().getScheduler().runAsync(this, new BungeePoster(essage, name, iconUrl));
```
Same parameters as in the Bukkit version.
